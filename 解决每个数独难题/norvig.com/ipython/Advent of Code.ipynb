    "\n",
    "From Dec. 1 to Dec. 25, [I](http://norvig.com) will be solving the puzzles that appear each day at *[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)*. The two-part puzzles are released at midnight EST (9:00PM my time); points are awarded to the first 100 people to solve the day's puzzles. The code shown here basically represents what I did to solve the problem, but slightly cleaned up:\n",
    "- On days when I start at 9:00PM and am competing against the clock, I take shortcuts. I use shorter names, because I'm not a fast typer. I run test cases in the Jupyter Notebook, but don't make them into `assert` statements. Even then, I'm not really competitive with the fastest solvers.\n",
    "- On days when I don't start until all the points are gone, what you see here is pretty much exactly what I did, or at least what I ended up with after correcting typos and other errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the problems completely, you will have to read the full description in the **\"[Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1):\"** link in each day's section header.\n",

    "\n",
    "- I'll import my favorite modules and functions, so I don't have to do it each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From  looking at [last year's](http://adventofcode.com/2015) puzzles, I knew that there would be a data file on many days, so I defined `Input` to open the file (and for those using this notebook on a remote machine, to fetch the file from the web). My data files are at [http://norvig.com/ipython/advent2016/](http://norvig.com/ipython/advent2016/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- From working on another puzzle site, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I had built up a collection of utility functions, shown below:"
