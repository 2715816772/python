      "To me, these are interesting questions because, first, I have a (slight) personal connection to Solomon Golomb (my former colleague at USC) and to Nelson Blachman (the father of my colleague Nancy Blachman), who presented the problem to  Antonik, and second, I find it interesting that the problems span the range from mathematical to computational. I wonder how the way I look at the problems compares to others who have a different mix of these two disciplines."

But if we fill the first two variables with 1 &times; 3, that is the same rectangle as 3 &times; 1. So divide 10! by 2<sup>5</sup> to account for the fact that each of 5 rectangles can appear 2 ways.  Similarly, if we fill A and B with 1 &times; 3, that yields the same set as if we filled C and D with 1 &times; 3.  So divide again by 5! (the number of permutations of 5 things) to account for this.\n",

      "**Method 2: Count without repetitions**: The example set is presented in [lexicographical order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order): in each rectangle the smaller component is listed first, and in the set, the rectangles with smaller first components are listed first.  An alternate to \"count and divide\" is to count directly how many sets there are in lexicographical order.  We'll work from left to right.  How many choices are there for variable A?  Only on
