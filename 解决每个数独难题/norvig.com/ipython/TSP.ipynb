    "Do we understand precisely what the problem is asking? Do we understand all the concepts that the problem talks about?  Do we understand them well enough to implement them in a programming language? Let's take a first pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A set of cities**: We will need to represent a set of cities; Python's `set` datatype might be appropriate.\n",
    "- **Distance between each pair of cities**: If `A` and `B` are cities, this could be a function, `distance(A, B),` or a table lookup, `distance[A][B]`.  The resulting distance will be a real number.\n",
    "- **City**: All we have to know about an individual city is how far it is from other cities. We don't have to know its name, population, best restaurants, or anything else. So a city could be just an integer (0, 1, 2, ...) used as an index into a distance table, or a city could be a pair of (x, y) coordinates, if we are using straight-line distance on a plane.\n",
    "- **Tour**: A tour is a specified order in which to visit the cities; Python's `list` or `tuple` datatypes would work. For example, given the set of cities `{A, B, C, D}`, a tour might be the list `[B, D, A, C]`, which means to travel from `B` to `D` to `A` to `C` and finally back to `B`.\n",
    "- **Shortest possible tour**: The shortest tour is the one whose tour length is the minimum of all tours.\n",
    "- **Tour length**: The sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour (including the last city back to the first city).   Probably  a function, `tour_length(tour)`.\n",
    "- **What is ...**: We can define a function to answer the question *what is the shortest possible tour?*  The function takes a set of cities as input and returns a tour as output. I will use the convention that any such function will have a name ending in the letters \"`tsp`\", the traditional abbreviation for Traveling Salesperson Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage I have a rough sketch of how to attack the problem.  I don't have all the answers, and I haven't committed to specific representations for all the concepts, but I know what all the pieces are, and I don't see anything that stops me from proceeding."

But before we can decide about how to represent cities, and before we can define `distance(A, B)`,  we have to make a choice. In the fully general version of the TSP, the \"distance\" between two cities could be anything: it could factor in the amount of time it takes to travel between cities, the twistiness of the road, or anything else. The `distance(A, B)` might be different from `distance(B, A)`. So the distances could be represented by a matrix `distance[A][B]`, where any entry in the matrix could be any (non-negative) numeric value.\n",

So a city can be represented by a two-dimensional point: a pair of *x* and *y* coordinates. We will use the constructor function `City`, so that `City(300, 0)` creates a city with x-coordinate of 300 and y coordinate of 0.  Then `distance(A, B)` will be a function that uses the *x* and *y* coordinates to compute the distance between `A` and `B`.\n",

    "* **complex:** Python already has the two-dimensional point as a built-in numeric data type, but in a non-obvious way: as `complex` numbers, which inhabit the two-dimensional (real &times; imaginary) plane.  **Pro:** efficient. **Con:** a little confusing; doesn't distinguish Points from other complex numbers.\n",

    "1. IPython's matplotlib plots (by default) in a rectangle that is 1.5 times wider than it is high; that's why I specified a width of 900 and a height of 600. If you want the coordinates of your cities to be bounded by a different size rectangle, you can change width or height.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes I want `Cities(n)` to be a true function, returning the same result each time. This is very helpful for getting repeatable results: if I run a test twice, I get the same results twice. \n",
    "But other times I would like to be able to do an experiment, where, for example, I call `Cities(n)` 30 times and get 30 different sets, and I then compute the average tour length produced by my algorithm across these 30 sets. Can I get both behaviors out of one function? *Yes!*  The trick is the additional optional parameter, `seed`.  Two calls to `Cities` with the same `n` and `seed` parameters will always return the same set of cities, and two calls with different values for `seed` will return different sets. This is implemented by calling the function `random.seed`, which resets the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once I create a set of Cities, I don't want anyone messing with my set. For example, I don't want an algorithm that claims to \"solve\" a problem by deleting half the cities from the input set, then finding a tour of the remaining cities.  Therefore, I make `Cities` return a `frozenset` rather than a `set`.  A `frozenset` is *immutable*; nobody can change it once it is created. (Likewise, each city is immutable.)\n",
